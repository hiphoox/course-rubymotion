Chapter 15 - Notification Center
==============================

Digital Photo Frame
-------------------

Time travel has not been invented yet, so we most preserve our mosts precious memories in one way or another, have done said that, for the next series of chapters we are going to build an application that help us to doing so. 
For this chapter we are going to build the main screen the "photo frame", but in a more fashion way of course on an iDevice.

First at all we have to remember that objects are always sending messages one each other, but some times all objects may be interested in what just one object hast to say, but keep all the objects connected may be not a good strategy, for this reason we have a very handful tool, the notification center.

Now its time to create our ViewController that will hold our photo, run the rake command and give "PhotoFrame" as name of the application 


[source, sh]
--------------------------------------
$ motion create PhotoFrame
--------------------------------------

[NOTE]
Please add the assets to the resources folder of your project. You can find them under the resources folder and inside there is a folder images with the assets necessary for the chapter.  

Now create a new file named *photo_frame_view_controller.rb* in app folder and add the following code.

[source, ruby]
----------------------------------------------------------------
class PhotoViewController < UIViewController
  
  def viewDidLoad

    view.backgroundColor = UIColor.lightGrayColor
  end 

end
----------------------------------------------------------------

Save your file and run the rake command:

[source, sh]
----------------------------------------------------------------
$ rake
----------------------------------------------------------------

Don't forget to set it as rootViewController in your *app_delegate.rb* file because this ViewController will be useful for present our photo and also use the photo that comes in chapter 15 directory and paste it in your resources folder.

[source, ruby]
----------------------------------------------------------------
class AppDelegate

  def application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions) 

    @window = UIWindow.alloc.initWithFrame(UIScreen.mainScreen.bounds)
    @window.rootViewController = PhotoFrameViewController.alloc.init
    @window.makeKeyAndVisible
    true
  end

end
----------------------------------------------------------------

The next step is add an UIImage to our PhotoFrameViewController feel free to create a file for the UIElements like *photo_view_utilities.rb*

[source, ruby]
----------------------------------------------------------------
def photoUIImageView

  image = UIImage.imageNamed("me.png")
  photoView = UIImageView.alloc.initWithImage(image)
  photoView.frame =  CGRectMake(20,20, 280, 420)
  photoView
end
----------------------------------------------------------------

Don't forget to add the image to the view in the PhotoFrameViewController 

[source, ruby]
----------------------------------------------------------------
class PhotoFrameViewController < UIViewController

  def viewDidLoad

    view.backgroundColor = UIColor.lightGrayColor
    view.addSubview(photoUIImageView)
  end 

end
----------------------------------------------------------------


Save your file and compile the project to see if everything goes well, You will be able to see a wild cat:

.Picture Frame
image::resources/ch15-Notifications/ch15_PictureFrame.png[Picture Frame]


Now Rotate the simulator or the device.

.Landscape Frame
image::resources/ch15-Notifications/ch15_LandscapeFrame.png[Landscape Frame]


What just happened here? Everything indicates that the image did not adjust accordingly to the orientation.
It may be useful if the device can tell us when it rotates so we can act in response; guess what actually it tell us, we just have to listen carefully or in this case subscribe our view controller to this notification.

UIDevice Notification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's add register our photocontroller to receive notifications when the orientation of the device changes, add the following methods in your *photo_frame_view_controller.rb* file

[source, ruby]
----------------------------------------------------------------
def orientationChanged(notification)

  puts notification.object.orientation
end
   
def registerDeviceNotification

    # Get the device object
    device = UIDevice.currentDevice
    # Tell it to start monitoring the accelerometer for orientation
    device.beginGeneratingDeviceOrientationNotifications
    # Get the notification center for the app
    nc = NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter
    # Add yourself as an observer
    nc.addObserver(self, selector: :'orientationChanged:',name:UIDeviceOrientationDidChangeNotification ,object:device)
end
----------------------------------------------------------------

You can rotate tour simulator by holding the 'command' key and use the directions arrows, you will notice a series of number form 1 to 4 printed on your console, but that number means? In fact there are an enumeration:

[source, c]
----------------------------------------------------------------
typedef enum {
   UIDeviceOrientationUnknown,
   UIDeviceOrientationPortrait,
   UIDeviceOrientationPortraitUpsideDown,
   UIDeviceOrientationLandscapeLeft,
   UIDeviceOrientationLandscapeRight,
   UIDeviceOrientationFaceUp,
   UIDeviceOrientationFaceDown
} UIDeviceOrientation;
----------------------------------------------------------------

After know that, we can make a little improvements to our method  ***orientationChanged*** in our *photo_frame_view_controller.rb* file.

[source, ruby]
----------------------------------------------------------------
def orientationChanged(notification)

  deviceOrientation = notification.object.orientation
    if deviceOrientation == UIDeviceOrientationLandscapeLeft || deviceOrientation == UIDeviceOrientationLandscapeRight
      
      @imageView.frame = CGRectMake(20,20, 440, 260)
  
    else
      @imageView.frame = CGRectMake(20,20, 280, 420)
  end
end
----------------------------------------------------------------

Run your application and rotate the device, and watch carefully the landscape mode

.Landscape Picture
image::resources/ch15-Notifications/ch15_LandscapePicture.png[Landscape Picture]


Autorotation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Rotation it’s a very common task between iOS applications, you can use UIDevice Notification, but this may be a lot of work, instead we can use auto rotation for this purpose.

We can achieve this if the view is controlled by an UIViewController, we ask to a view controller if its okay to rotate the view, if the view controller agrees, the view it's rotated and resized also it's sub-views.

For this purpose we need to add the following method to our *photo_frame_view_controller.rb*, and don't subscribe to the UIDevice Notifications in the viewDidLoad Method

[source, ruby]
----------------------------------------------------------------
def viewDidLoad

  view.backgroundColor = UIColor.lightGrayColor
  @imageView = photoUIImageView;
  view.addSubview(@imageView)
  #registerDeviceNotification
end 
---------------------------------------------------------------- 

[source, ruby]
----------------------------------------------------------------
def shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation(interfaceOrientation)

  # Return YES if incoming orientation is Portrait
  #  or either of the Landscapes, otherwise, return NO
  shouldRotate = NO
  if (interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait) || UIInterfaceOrientationIsLandscape(interfaceOrientation)
    shouldRotate = YES    
  end 

  shouldRotate 
end 
----------------------------------------------------------------  

At this point it seems that our previous work has disappeared, and its because we did not tell how the UIImage should be resized, let's modified the methods that return the UIImageView whit the following auto resizing mask:

[source, ruby]
----------------------------------------------------------------
def photoUIImageView

  image = UIImage.imageNamed("me.png")
  photoView = UIImageView.alloc.initWithImage(image)
  photoView.frame =  CGRectMake(20,20, 280, 420)
  #The view resizes by expanding or shrinking its width.
  #The view resizes by expanding or shrinking its height.
  photoView.setAutoresizingMask(UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight)
  photoView
end
---------------------------------------------------------------- 

Save and then run your application, now all the previous work has returned
,as you can see the view  adjusts it's size automatically when devices rotates, fortunately we have additional resize masks

* UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleLeftMargin
* UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleRightMargin
* UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleTopMargin
* UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleBottomMargin

The only thing left its add a more fancy frame so we can get rid off that ugly gray background, open your *photo_view_utilities.rb* file and add the following method

[source, ruby]
----------------------------------------------------------------
def frameUIImageView

  image = UIImage.imageNamed("frame.png")
  photoView = UIImageView.alloc.initWithImage(image)
  photoView.frame =  CGRectMake(0,0, 320, 460)
  photoView.setAutoresizingMask(UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight)
  photoView
end
----------------------------------------------------------------

Now in your *photo_frame_view_controller.rb* add the frame image just before adding the picture image

[source, ruby]
----------------------------------------------------------------
def viewDidLoad

  @imageView = photoUIImageView;
  frameView = frameUIImageView;
  view.addSubview(frameView)
  view.addSubview(@imageView)
end 
----------------------------------------------------------------

.Photo Frame App
image::resources/ch15-Notifications/ch15_PhotoFrameApp.png[Photo Frame App]

Challenge - Status Bar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It seems that the only element that not fits right on this picture, its the status bar, try to remove it so we can appreciate in all the screen, add the following line at the beginning of your viewDidLoad method

[source, ruby]
----------------------------------------------------------------
UIApplication.sharedApplication.setStatusBarHidden(true ,animated:false)
----------------------------------------------------------------


Challenges
~~~~~~~~~~
*It will be nice if our digital photo frame could tell us the battery level, subscribe to UIDeviceBatteryLevelDidChangeNotification and enable batteryMonitoringEnabled.
Add a label that indicates the level of the battery, green when its above 10% and red when get lower or equal than 10%   

*Allow only portrait mode for the app, because in land scape we can looks like a little bit stretch
