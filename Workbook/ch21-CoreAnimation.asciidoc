Chapter 21 - Core Animation
===========================

In this chapter we will continue learning Core Animation implementing more complex animations and transitions. 

Lets begin! When you need more control on the animation, lets say move the layer along a path, control the duration or some easing, its required that you implement a explicit animation.

.Easing
[NOTE]
===============================
Easing means to control the acceleration or deceleration of the objects in the animation. This is used to simulate real life forces like friction or gravity.
===============================


Next we will look into the most basic type of explicit animations, CABasicAnimation

CABasicAnimation
----------------
Its a single key-frame animation, this means that you can only set the initial and final step of such application. An proper example will illustrate this better:

You need to move a layer from point A to point B. The initial step is A and the final is B, this is case of a single key-frame, but if you need to move from point A passing through point C, then point D and finally B this is a multi key-frame, which will cover it later.

In this perspective this kind of explicit animations are a lot like the implicit ones, the difference is that you can have more control on it like:

* Setting some delay on the animation
* Know when the animation finished
* Animation duration
* Combine multiple animations at once
* Reverse the animation on finish
* Repeat the animation indefinitely

The first thing we can do is change the sun move animation which is implicit to a explicit one, for this lets open our **Layer** project, and edit the **view_tap** method to look like the following:

[source, ruby]
--------------
def view_tap(tap_gesture_recognizer)

  #Get the position of the touch according to the view
  tap_point_in_view = tap_gesture_recognizer.locationInView(self.view)


  # When we create an instance of a CABasicAnimation, its needed
  # to set which property we want to animate. In this case the property
  # is position, but it can be backgroundColor, cornerRadius or any other
  animation = CABasicAnimation.animationWithKeyPath('position')

  # Set the animation duration  
  animation.duration = 1

  # We need to set the initial value of the animation and the final one, 
  animation.fromValue = NSValue.valueWithCGPoint(@sun_layer.position)
  animation.toValue = NSValue.valueWithCGPoint(tap_point_in_view)

  
  # Add the animation to the layer that we want to animate, and set a 
  # name for it, in this case position_animation. The name is used 
  # if later we need to access the animation again in another part of the code
  @sun_layer.addAnimation(animation, forKey:'position_animation')
  
end
--------------

.Animation Blinking to Start
image::resources/ch21-CoreAnimation/ch21_AnimationBlinkToStart.png[Animation Blinking to Start]

Uh? What happen? The sun move to the position we touch, but at the end of the animation it return to its initial value. This happens because the animation is independent of the layer that is running into, it will move the layer to the touch position but at the end if you don't change the layer property it will return to the initial state.

Try the following:

[source, ruby]
--------------
def view_tap(tap_gesture_recognizer)

  #Get the position of the touch according to the view
  tap_point_in_view = tap_gesture_recognizer.locationInView(self.view)


  # When we create an instance of a CABasicAnimation, its needed
  # to set which property we want to animate. In this case the property
  # is position, but it can be backgroundColor, cornerRadius or any other
  animation = CABasicAnimation.animationWithKeyPath('position')

  # Set the animation duration  
  animation.duration = 1

  # We need to set the initial value of the animation and the final one
  animation.fromValue = NSValue.valueWithCGPoint(@sun_layer.position)
  animation.toValue = NSValue.valueWithCGPoint(tap_point_in_view)


  # Change the layer property that we want to be animated, the position of
  # this line is important. It must be before the addAnimation message.
  @sun_layer.position = tap_point_in_view

  # Add the animation to the layer that we want to animate, and set a 
  # name for it, in this case position_animation. The name is used 
  # if later we need to access the animation again in another part of the code
  @sun_layer.addAnimation(animation, forKey:'position_animation')
end
--------------

.Animation Complete
image::resources/ch21-CoreAnimation/ch21_AnimationComplete.png[Animation Complete]

Now it works as expected! The animation is pretty slow because we set to it 1 second, try changing it for more fun. 

.Interpolation
[NOTE]
===============================
Did you notice that close the distance of the animation is more slow? This is because it has to cover less distance in the same duration.
===============================


Lets try something new, reverse the animation once is finished. This is accomplished with the following code:

[source, ruby]
--------------
def view_tap(tap_gesture_recognizer)

  #Get the position of the touch according to the view
  tap_point_in_view = tap_gesture_recognizer.locationInView(self.view)


  # When we create an instance of a CABasicAnimation, its needed
  # to set which property we want to animate. In this case the property
  # is position, but it can be backgroundColor, cornerRadius or any other
  animation = CABasicAnimation.animationWithKeyPath('position')

  # Set the animation duration  
  animation.duration = 1

  # We need to set the initial value of the animation and the final one
  animation.fromValue = NSValue.valueWithCGPoint(@sun_layer.position)
  animation.toValue = NSValue.valueWithCGPoint(tap_point_in_view)

  # Tell the animation that we need to reverse at finish
  animation.autoreverses = true

  # Add the animation to the layer that we want to animate, and set a 
  # name for it, in this case position_animation. The name is used 
  # if later we need to access the animation again in another part of the code
  @sun_layer.addAnimation(animation, forKey:'position_animation')
end
--------------

.Animation Returning to Starting Point
image::resources/ch21-CoreAnimation/ch21_AnimationReturningToStartingPoint.png[Animation Returning to Starting Point]

If we want to make that cycle of moving and returning happen 100 times?

[source, ruby]
--------------
def view_tap(tap_gesture_recognizer)

  #Get the position of the touch according to the view
  tap_point_in_view = tap_gesture_recognizer.locationInView(self.view)


  # When we create an instance of a CABasicAnimation, its needed
  # to set which property we want to animate. In this case the property
  # is position, but it can be backgroundColor, cornerRadius or any other
  animation = CABasicAnimation.animationWithKeyPath('position')

  # Set the animation duration  
  animation.duration = 1

  # We need to set the initial value of the animation and the final one
  animation.fromValue = NSValue.valueWithCGPoint(@sun_layer.position)
  animation.toValue = NSValue.valueWithCGPoint(tap_point_in_view)

  # Tell the animation that we need to reverse at finish
  animation.autoreverses = true

  # Set the repeat count to 100
  animation.repeatCount = 100

  # Add the animation to the layer that we want to animate, and set a 
  # name for it, in this case position_animation. The name is used 
  # if later we need to access the animation again in another part of the code
  @sun_layer.addAnimation(animation, forKey:'position_animation')
end
--------------

.Animation Loop
image::resources/ch21-CoreAnimation/ch21_AnimationLoop.png[Animation Loop]

What about combining two animations: a spinning one with the moving one

[source, ruby]
--------------
def view_tap(tap_gesture_recognizer)

  #Get the position of the touch according to the view
  tap_point_in_view = tap_gesture_recognizer.locationInView(self.view)


  # When we create an instance of a CABasicAnimation, its needed
  # to set which property we want to animate. In this case the property
  # is position, but it can be backgroundColor, cornerRadius or any other
  translation_animation = CABasicAnimation.animationWithKeyPath('position')

  # Set the animation duration  
  translation_animation.duration = 1

  # We need to set the initial value of the animation and the final one
  translation_animation.fromValue = NSValue.valueWithCGPoint(@sun_layer.position)
  translation_animation.toValue = NSValue.valueWithCGPoint(tap_point_in_view)


  # Change the layer property that we want to be animated, the position of
  # this line is important. It must be before the addAnimation message.
  @sun_layer.position = tap_point_in_view

  # Add the animation to the layer that we want to animate, and set a 
  # name for it, in this case position animation. The name is used 
  # if later we need to access the animation again in another part of the code
  @sun_layer.addAnimation(translation_animation, forKey:'translation_animation')


  # Create another instance of the CABasicAnimation with the property 'transform.rotation.z'
  # this property allows us to change the layer in any of the three dimensions, in this case
  # y axis
  rotation_animation = CABasicAnimation.animationWithKeyPath('transform.rotation.z')

  # Take a note here we are setting 360 degrees, but Core Animation works with radians
  # thats why the conversion PI * 2
  rotation_animation.toValue = NSNumber.numberWithFloat(Math::PI * 2)

  # Set the duration according with the other animation
  rotation_animation.duration = 1

  # Add the animation to the layer
  @sun_layer.addAnimation(rotation_animation, forKey:'rotation_animation')
end
--------------

.Animation Spinning and Moving
image::resources/ch21-CoreAnimation/ch21_AnimationSpinning.png[Animation Spinning and Moving]


Moving the clouds
-----------------

The sun looks a little lonely right? What about adding some clouds and make them move across the screen?

The first step is adding the images of the clouds, please copy them from **Define deployment target** into the resources folder of the app.

Next lets add the layers into our view, in the following way:

[source, ruby]
--------------
def loadView

  # Lets create a view for our view controller
  self.view = UIView.alloc.initWithFrame(UIScreen.mainScreen.bounds)

  # Instantiate a gesture recognizer to handle the user touch
  tap_gesture_recognizer = UITapGestureRecognizer.alloc.initWithTarget(self,
                                                                       action:'view_tap:')

  self.view.addGestureRecognizer(tap_gesture_recognizer)

  layout_background_layer
  layout_sun_layer
  layout_cloud_layers
  layout_grass_layer
end

def layout_cloud_layers

  #Lets instance a new layer for our first cloud image                             
  first_cloud_layer = CALayer.layer
  first_cloud_layer.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 153, 82)
  first_cloud_layer.position = CGPointMake(90, 170)

  #Load the image into memory
  first_cloud_image = UIImage.imageNamed("bgCloud1.png")

  # Set the image as content of the layer
  first_cloud_layer.contents = first_cloud_image.CGImage

  self.view.layer.addSublayer(first_cloud_layer)


  # New layer for our second cloud image                             
  second_cloud_layer = CALayer.layer
  second_cloud_layer.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 185, 96)
  second_cloud_layer.position = CGPointMake(220, 130)

  second_cloud_image = UIImage.imageNamed("bgCloud2.png")

  second_cloud_layer.contents = second_cloud_image.CGImage

  self.view.layer.addSublayer(second_cloud_layer)
end
--------------

If we run now the application, you should see the following:

.Sun & Clouds
image::resources/ch21-CoreAnimation/ch21_SunAndClouds.png[Sun & Clouds]

Pretty but not amazing!, Now lets add some animation to the clouds:

[source, ruby]
--------------
def layout_cloud_layers

  # Lets instance a new layer for our first cloud image                             
  first_cloud_layer = CALayer.layer
  first_cloud_layer.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 153, 82)
  first_cloud_layer.position = CGPointMake(-153, 170)

  # Load the image into memory
  first_cloud_image = UIImage.imageNamed("bgCloud1.png")

  # Set the image as content of the layer
  first_cloud_layer.contents = first_cloud_image.CGImage

  self.view.layer.addSublayer(first_cloud_layer)
  

  # Instanciate a new animation for the first cloud move
  first_cloud_animation = CABasicAnimation.animationWithKeyPath('position')

   # Set the animation duration  
  first_cloud_animation.duration = 7

  # We need to set the initial value of the animation and the final one
  first_cloud_animation.fromValue = NSValue.valueWithCGPoint(first_cloud_layer.position)
  
  # Final position for the first cloud
  first_cloud_final_position = CGPointMake(473, 170)

  first_cloud_animation.toValue = NSValue.valueWithCGPoint(first_cloud_final_position)

  # Because we want a infinite animation we set the repeat count to Float Max
  first_cloud_animation.repeatCount = Float::MAX

  first_cloud_layer.addAnimation(first_cloud_animation, forKey:'position_animation')



  # New layer for our second cloud image                             
  second_cloud_layer = CALayer.layer
  second_cloud_layer.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 185, 96)
  second_cloud_layer.position = CGPointMake(-185, 130)

  second_cloud_image = UIImage.imageNamed("bgCloud2.png")

  second_cloud_layer.contents = second_cloud_image.CGImage

  self.view.layer.addSublayer(second_cloud_layer)


  # Instanciate a new animation for the second cloud move
  second_cloud_animation = CABasicAnimation.animationWithKeyPath('position')

  # Set the animation duration  
  second_cloud_animation.duration = 5

  # We need to set the initial value of the animation and the final one
  second_cloud_animation.fromValue = NSValue.valueWithCGPoint(first_cloud_layer.position)
  
  # Final position for the second cloud
  second_cloud_final_position = CGPointMake(505, 130)

  second_cloud_animation.toValue = NSValue.valueWithCGPoint(second_cloud_final_position)

  # Because we want a infinite animation we set the repeat count to Float Max
  second_cloud_animation.repeatCount = Float::MAX

  second_cloud_layer.addAnimation(second_cloud_animation, forKey:'position_animation')
end
--------------

IMPORTANT: Please take notice that the cloud position changed

.Cloud Animation
image::resources/ch21-CoreAnimation/ch21_AnimationClouds.png[Cloud Animation]


Yes, it looks kind of good. But the animation is too linear the clouds does not look like the real life, what we can do is adding some easing with a timing function. The objective is when the cloud appear on the screen go faster and then it decelerate until its finished. This kind of easing is called EasyOut:

Lets apply it to the code:

[source, ruby]
--------------
def layout_cloud_layers

  # Lets instance a new layer for our first cloud image                             
  first_cloud_layer = CALayer.layer
  first_cloud_layer.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 153, 82)
  first_cloud_layer.position = CGPointMake(-153, 170)

  # Load the image into memory
  first_cloud_image = UIImage.imageNamed("bgCloud1.png")

  # Set the image as content of the layer
  first_cloud_layer.contents = first_cloud_image.CGImage

  self.view.layer.addSublayer(first_cloud_layer)
  

  # Instanciate a new animation for the first cloud move
  first_cloud_animation = CABasicAnimation.animationWithKeyPath('position')

   # Set the animation duration  
  first_cloud_animation.duration = 7

  # We need to set the initial value of the animation and the final one
  first_cloud_animation.fromValue = NSValue.valueWithCGPoint(first_cloud_layer.position)
  
  # Final position for the first cloud
  first_cloud_final_position = CGPointMake(473, 170)

  first_cloud_animation.toValue = NSValue.valueWithCGPoint(first_cloud_final_position)

  # Because we want a infinite animation we set the repeat count to Float Max
  first_cloud_animation.repeatCount = Float::MAX

  # Apply the timing function to simulate the Easy out Easing
  first_cloud_animation.timingFunction = CAMediaTimingFunction.functionWithName(KCAMediaTimingFunctionEaseOut)

  first_cloud_layer.addAnimation(first_cloud_animation, forKey:'position_animation')



  # New layer for our second cloud image                             
  second_cloud_layer = CALayer.layer
  second_cloud_layer.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 185, 96)
  second_cloud_layer.position = CGPointMake(-185, 130)

  second_cloud_image = UIImage.imageNamed("bgCloud2.png")

  second_cloud_layer.contents = second_cloud_image.CGImage

  self.view.layer.addSublayer(second_cloud_layer)


  # Instanciate a new animation for the second cloud move
  second_cloud_animation = CABasicAnimation.animationWithKeyPath('position')

  # Set the animation duration  
  second_cloud_animation.duration = 5

  # We need to set the initial value of the animation and the final one
  second_cloud_animation.fromValue = NSValue.valueWithCGPoint(first_cloud_layer.position)
  
  # Final position for the second cloud
  second_cloud_final_position = CGPointMake(505, 130)

  second_cloud_animation.toValue = NSValue.valueWithCGPoint(second_cloud_final_position)

  # Because we want a infinite animation we set the repeat count to Float Max
  second_cloud_animation.repeatCount = Float::MAX

  
  # Apply the timing function to simulate the Easy out Easing
  second_cloud_animation.timingFunction = CAMediaTimingFunction.functionWithName(KCAMediaTimingFunctionEaseOut)

  second_cloud_layer.addAnimation(second_cloud_animation, forKey:'position_animation')
end
--------------

.Cloud Animation with Easing
image::resources/ch21-CoreAnimation/ch21_AnimationCloudsWithEasing.png[Cloud Animation with Easing]

Subtle right? Thats the idea! It now looks more that the wind blows stronger at the first and then it slows down. But what is really happening? 

Do you remember the part of the interpolation? We were saying in that moment that it is the calculus between the initial value and the final every millisecond of the sequence. It means that if we move 3 points during 3 seconds, it will move one point per second right? 

Yes it does if our timing function is linear (Which is the default), but if we change that to a EasyIn what is really happening is that in the first second it moves 1.5 points, in the second 1 point and in the final second .5 points. Thats makes the illusion of decelerating

In iOS they are 4 default easing available for the timing functions:

.iOS Easings
image::resources/ch21-CoreAnimation/ch21_Easings.png[iOS Easings]

Also if you don't like anyone, you can implement your custom timing function.


CAKeyFrameAnimation
-------------------

Until this part we have created single key-frame animations, from a value to value, without intermediates. But what happens when we need to set more points into a moving animation, by example the arc that makes the sun in the sky during the day? 

If we start on the left bottom corner on the screen and use a CABasicAnimation to move the sun to the right bottom, it will move in a straight line, so we will need to add a middle point in top middle of the screen. This is done using a CAKeyFrameAnimation:

[source, ruby]
--------------
def loadView

  # Lets create a view for our view controller
  self.view = UIView.alloc.initWithFrame(UIScreen.mainScreen.bounds)

  layout_background_layer
  layout_sun_layer
  layout_cloud_layers
  layout_grass_layer
  load_sun_animation
end


def load_sun_animation

  # Create a new instance of CAKeyframeAnimation
  translation_animation = CAKeyframeAnimation.animationWithKeyPath('position')

  translation_animation.duration = 15

  # We need to have an array for containing all the positions
  values = NSMutableArray.alloc.init


  # Initial Sun Position
  initial_sun_position = NSValue.valueWithCGPoint(CGPointMake(-180, 660))
  values.addObject(initial_sun_position)

  # Middle Sun Position
  middle_sun_position = NSValue.valueWithCGPoint(CGPointMake(155, 100))
  values.addObject(middle_sun_position)

  final_sun_position = NSValue.valueWithCGPoint(CGPointMake(500, 660))
  values.addObject(final_sun_position)


  translation_animation.values = values

     # Because we want a infinite animation we set the repeat count to Float Max
  translation_animation.repeatCount = Float::MAX

  # Apply the timing function to simulate the Easy out Easing
  translation_animation.timingFunction = CAMediaTimingFunction.functionWithName(KCAMediaTimingFunctionEaseInEaseOut)

  @sun_layer.addAnimation(translation_animation, forKey:'position_animation')
end
--------------

.Sun Straight Animation
image::resources/ch21-CoreAnimation/ch21_SunStraightAnimation.png[Sun Straight Animation]

We are improving! But the sun does not move in a straight line, so lets change does points into an arc:


[source, ruby]
--------------
def load_sun_animation

  # Create a new instance of CAKeyframeAnimation
  translation_animation = CAKeyframeAnimation.animationWithKeyPath('position')

  # Set the animation duration  
  translation_animation.duration = 15


  # Using a BezierPath we will create the Arc for the position 
  # animation to cover, is better this way using lines and curves
  # than setting every point by ourselfs
  sun_path = UIBezierPath.bezierPath
  sun_path.moveToPoint(CGPointMake(-90, 660))
  sun_path.addCurveToPoint(CGPointMake(410, 660), 
                           controlPoint1:CGPointMake(90, -100), 
                           controlPoint2:CGPointMake(230, -100))

  
  # Assign the path to the animation
  translation_animation.path = sun_path.CGPath

  # Because we want a infinite animation we set the repeat count to Float Max
  translation_animation.repeatCount = Float::MAX

  # Apply the timing function to simulate the Easy out Easing
  translation_animation.timingFunction = CAMediaTimingFunction.functionWithName(KCAMediaTimingFunctionEaseInEaseOut)

  @sun_layer.addAnimation(translation_animation, forKey:'position_animation')
end
--------------

.Sun Arc Animation
image::resources/ch21-CoreAnimation/ch21_SunArcAnimation.png[Sun Arc Animation]

Great! Now this is working, but how about combining the translation animation with a spinning one? (CABasicAnimation & CAKeyframeAnimation):

[source, ruby]
--------------
def load_sun_animation

 # Create a new instance of CAKeyframeAnimation
 translation_animation = CAKeyframeAnimation.animationWithKeyPath('position')

 # Set the animation duration

 # animation to cover, is better this way using lines and curves
 # than setting every point by ourselves
 sun_path = UIBezierPath.bezierPath
 sun_path.moveToPoint(CGPointMake(-90, 660))
 sun_path.addCurveToPoint(CGPointMake(410, 660), 
                          controlPoint1:CGPointMake(90, -100), 
                          controlPoint2:CGPointMake(230, -100))

 
 # Assign the path to the animation
 translation_animation.path = sun_path.CGPath

 # Because we want a infinite animation we set the repeat count to Float Max
 translation_animation.repeatCount = Float::MAX

 # Apply the timing function to simulate the Easy out Easing
 translation_animation.timingFunction = CAMediaTimingFunction.functionWithName(KCAMediaTimingFunctionEaseInEaseOut)


 @sun_layer.addAnimation(translation_animation, forKey:'position_animation')


 # Create another instance of the CABasicAnimation with the property 'transform.rotation.z'
 # this property allows us to change the layer in any of the three dimensions, in this case
 # y axis
 rotation_animation = CABasicAnimation.animationWithKeyPath('transform.rotation.z')

 # Take a note here we are setting 360 degrees, but Core Animation works with radians
 # thats why the conversion PI * 2
 rotation_animation.toValue = NSNumber.numberWithFloat(Math::PI * 2)

 # Set the duration according with the other animation
 rotation_animation.duration = 5

  # Because we want a infinite animation we set the repeat count to Float Max
 rotation_animation.repeatCount = Float::MAX

 # Add the animation to the layer
 @sun_layer.addAnimation(rotation_animation, forKey:'rotation_animation')
end
--------------

But this is not the end of it, what about changing the colors of the sky according to the position of the sun? For this we will need to animate the background layer in the following way:

[source, ruby]
--------------
def load_sun_animation

 # Create a new instance of CAKeyframeAnimation

 sun_path.moveToPoint(CGPointMake(-90, 660))
 sun_path.addCurveToPoint(CGPointMake(410, 660), 
                          controlPoint1:CGPointMake(90, -100), 
                          controlPoint2:CGPointMake(230, -100))

 
 # Assign the path to the animation

.Sun Sunset Animation

It looks pretty good! But we are missing the night part right? Thats the next part of the exercise


Ready, Set, Action!
-------------------
Do you remember when we talk about know when a animation finish? We will need that part to present our night scene! The way to know when the animation finished is using the delegate pattern, lets implement it!

[source, ruby]

def load_sun_animation

  # Create a new instance of CAKeyframeAnimation
  translation_animation = CAKeyframeAnimation.animationWithKeyPath('position')

  # Set the animation duration  
  translation_animation.duration = 15


  # Using a BezierPath we will create the Arc for the position 
  # animation to cover, is better this way using lines and curves
  # than setting every point by ourselfs
  sun_path = UIBezierPath.bezierPath
  sun_path.moveToPoint(CGPointMake(-90, 660))
  sun_path.addCurveToPoint(CGPointMake(410, 660), 
                           controlPoint1:CGPointMake(90, -100), 
                           controlPoint2:CGPointMake(230, -100))

  
  # Assign the path to the animation
  translation_animation.path = sun_path.CGPath

  # Apply the timing function to simulate the Easy out Easing
  translation_animation.timingFunction = CAMediaTimingFunction.functionWithName(KCAMediaTimingFunctionEaseInEaseOut)

  # We assign self as delegate of the animation
  translation_animation.delegate = self
  translation_animation.removedOnCompletion = false

  @sun_layer.position = CGPointMake(410, 660)

  @sun_layer.addAnimation(translation_animation, forKey:'position_animation')


  # Create another instance of the CABasicAnimation with the property 'transform.rotation.z'
  # this property allows us to change the layer in any of the three dimensions, in this case
  # y axis
  rotation_animation = CABasicAnimation.animationWithKeyPath('transform.rotation.z')

  # Take a note here we are setting 360 degrees, but Core Animation works with radians
  # thats why the conversion PI * 2
  rotation_animation.toValue = NSNumber.numberWithFloat(Math::PI * 2)

  # Set the duration according with the other animation
  rotation_animation.duration = 5

   # Because we want a infinite animation we set the repeat count to Float Max
  rotation_animation.repeatCount = Float::MAX

  # Add the animation to the layer
  @sun_layer.addAnimation(rotation_animation, forKey:'rotation_animation')


  # We need to create an array of the color gradients thar we want the 
  # background transition into
  animation_colors = NSMutableArray.alloc.init

  # Because we are using a gradient, we need to have a 3 pair of colors for 
  # each transition


  # Last Night Color 
  last_night_color = NSMutableArray.alloc.init

  last_night_color.addObject(UIColor.colorWithWhite(0.051, alpha:1.0).CGColor)
  last_night_color.addObject(UIColor.colorWithRed(0.157, green:0.173, blue:0.192, alpha:1.0).CGColor)

  @background_layer.addAnimation(gradient_animation, forKey:'colors_animation')
end

def animationDidStop(animation, finished:flag)
  
  load_sun_animation
end
--------------

If you look close at the code, we don't change pretty much right? Only we remove the repeatCount and assign the view controller as delegate of the animation, this is for when the animation finishes we invoke the method **load_sun_animation** again to continue the loop 

IMPORTANT: Also we add one more color into the background transition, this last is important for the day break transition.

For the next step please copy the **bgMoon.png** from the **Define deployment target** into our application resources folder.

Lets add a new layer to include the new moon image:

[source, ruby]
--------------
def loadView

  # Lets create a view for our view controller
  self.view = UIView.alloc.initWithFrame(UIScreen.mainScreen.bounds)

  layout_background_layer
  layout_sun_layer
  layout_cloud_layers
  layout_moon_layer
  layout_grass_layer
  load_sun_animation
end


def layout_moon_layer

  # Lets instance a new layer for our first cloud image                             
  @moon_layer = CALayer.layer
  @moon_layer.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 120, 120)
  @moon_layer.position = CGPointMake(-120, 600)

  # Load the image into memory
  moon_image = UIImage.imageNamed("bgMoon.png")

  # Set the image as content of the layer
  @moon_layer.contents = moon_image.CGImage

  self.view.layer.addSublayer(@moon_layer)
end
--------------


We are close! Lets implement the moon animation adding the following method:

[source, ruby]
--------------
def load_moon_animation

  # Create a new instance of CAKeyframeAnimation
  translation_animation = CAKeyframeAnimation.animationWithKeyPath('position')

  # Set the animation duration  
  translation_animation.duration = 15


  # Using a BezierPath we will create the Arc for the position 
  # animation to cover, is better this way using lines and curves
  # than setting every point by ourselfs
  sun_path = UIBezierPath.bezierPath
  sun_path.moveToPoint(CGPointMake(-90, 660))
  sun_path.addCurveToPoint(CGPointMake(410, 660), 
                           controlPoint1:CGPointMake(90, -100), 
                           controlPoint2:CGPointMake(230, -100))

  
  # Assign the path to the animation
  translation_animation.path = sun_path.CGPath

  # Apply the timing function to simulate the Easy out Easing
  translation_animation.timingFunction = CAMediaTimingFunction.functionWithName(KCAMediaTimingFunctionEaseInEaseOut)

  # We assign self as delegate of the animation
  translation_animation.delegate = self
  translation_animation.removedOnCompletion = false

  @moon_layer.position = CGPointMake(410, 660)

  @moon_layer.addAnimation(translation_animation, forKey:'position_animation')


  # We need to create an array of the color gradients thar we want the 
  # background transition into
  animation_colors = NSMutableArray.alloc.init

  # Because we are using a gradient, we need to have a 3 pair of colors for 
  # each transition

  # The last gradient used in the sun animation
  last_day_color = NSMutableArray.alloc.init

  last_day_color.addObject(UIColor.colorWithRed(0.094, green:0.086, blue:0.686, alpha:1.0).CGColor)
  last_day_color.addObject(UIColor.colorWithRed(0.635, green:0.051, blue:0.404, alpha:1.0).CGColor)
  last_day_color.addObject(UIColor.colorWithRed(0.635, green:0.051, blue:0.404, alpha:1.0).CGColor)


  # Night Colors
  initial_colors = NSMutableArray.alloc.init

  initial_colors.addObject(UIColor.colorWithRed(0.008, green:0.169, blue:0.302, alpha:1.0).CGColor)
  initial_colors.addObject(UIColor.colorWithRed(0.051, green:0.365, blue:0.627, alpha:1.0).CGColor)
  initial_colors.addObject(UIColor.colorWithRed(0.051, green:0.365, blue:0.627, alpha:1.0).CGColor)


  # Midnight Colors
  final_colors = NSMutableArray.alloc.init

  final_colors.addObject(UIColor.colorWithWhite(0.051, alpha:1.0).CGColor)
  final_colors.addObject(UIColor.colorWithRed(0.157, green:0.173, blue:0.192, alpha:1.0).CGColor)
  final_colors.addObject(UIColor.colorWithRed(0.157, green:0.173, blue:0.192, alpha:1.0).CGColor)

  animation_colors.addObject(last_day_color)
  animation_colors.addObject(initial_colors)
  animation_colors.addObject(final_colors)


  # Create a new instance of CAKeyframeAnimation with the property
  # of colors
  gradient_animation = CAKeyframeAnimation.animationWithKeyPath('colors')

  # Set the animation duration  
  gradient_animation.duration = 15

  # Set the matrix of gradient colors into the animation
  gradient_animation.values = animation_colors

  @background_layer.addAnimation(gradient_animation, forKey:'colors_animation')
end
--------------

Now we have the sun and the moon layers and animations, so as last part we need to transition between animations to simulate night and day. The best we can do at this point is on the animation delegate, invoke the moon animation if the sun ended and otherwise. This is implemented the following way:

[source, ruby]
--------------
# CAAnimation delegate call
def animationDidStop(animation, finished:flag)

  # Using the key of the addAnimation we can get the animation and compare
  # it against the one that finish to know if it is the sun or the moon one
  if animation == @sun_layer.animationForKey('position_animation')
  
    load_moon_animation
  else
  
    load_sun_animation
  end
--------------

Interesting how can we retrieve the animation instance from a layer using the same keypath used when we add it. Thats the way can we determinate which application was finished!

Now run the application and enjoy!

.Sun & Moon Animation
image::resources/ch21-CoreAnimation/ch21_SunAndMoonAnimation.png[Sun & Moon Animation]


Challenges
----------
. In the **Define deployment path** are a couple of star images, the challenge is make a animation with them moving from top to bottom, only when the moon is rising. And remove them with another animation when the sun is rising

. Change the past animation of the stars to look like shooting stars, enter and leaving leaving the screen
