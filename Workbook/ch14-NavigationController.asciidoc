Chapter 14 - Navigation Controllers
=================================

Last chapter we added custom cells to our news table. In this chapter we will add navigation to it. Our table view is showing us a list of news items, and that's it. We need to add a way to navigate from that list to the full detail of the news item.

We will do that using a navigation controller.


Setting up the project.
-----------------------

As usual, we will begin by setting up our project. Open the *14-NavigationController/resources/code/* folder. You will find the project as we finished in chapter 13 in the *Cocoaheads* folder and the Xcode project we did in chapter 10 inside the *CocoaheadsViews* folder. 

.Current Application

Creating our Navigation Controller
---------------------------------

The first step is to show the NewsViewController inside a Navigation Controller. Open the file *app_delegate.rb*. In the method *appTabBarController* is where we are creating our Tab Bar and the view controllers of the app. Change it so the third tab will present a Navigation Controller with the NewsViewController in it:

[source, ruby]
-------------------
def appTabBarController

  tab_bar_controller = UITabBarController.alloc.init
  tab_bar_controller.viewControllers = [
    CalendarViewController.alloc.init,
    NextEventViewController.alloc.init,
    UINavigationController.alloc.initWithRootViewController(NewsViewController.alloc.initWithStyle(UITableViewStylePlain)) 
  ]
  tab_bar_controller.tabBar.backgroundImage = UIImage.imageNamed "bgTabBar"
  tab_bar_controller
end
------------------


Remember that a UINavigationController keeps a stack of view controllers. Thus, we should initialize the controller with a *root* that will be the first controller to be presented.

Run the app

.Navigation Controller

Customizing the Navigation Bar
-----------------------------

We have two problems:
1. The Table header looks weird below the Navigation Bar.
2. The Navigation Bar has its default blueish color that does not match the look and feel of the app.

To solve these problems we will remove the table header and customize the Navigation Bar.

First, *delete* these methods from the NewsViewController class:

[source, ruby]
-----------------
def tableView(tableView, viewForHeaderInSection:section)

  buttonsView
end  


def tableView(tableView, heightForHeaderInSection:section)

  64.0
end  
----------------  

Now let's add our background image to the navigation bar. *Create* this method in the NewsViewController.

[source, ruby]
--------------------
def setupNavigationBar

  self.navigationController.navigationBar.setBackgroundImage(UIImage.imageNamed("bgTitleBar"), 
    forBarMetrics:UIBarMetricsDefault)    
end    
-------------------


For the Navigation Bar we can specify a background image for two different types of metrics:

- UIBarMetricsDefault. Portrait mode, thus the image for the iPhone should have a width of 320px.
- UIBarMetricsLandscapePhone. Landscape mode, the image must have 480px. of width.


Call this method from the *viewDidLoad* method:

[source, ruby]
-------------
def viewDidLoad

  setupNavigationBar
end
-------------  

Run the app:

.Navigation Bar
image::Resources/ch14-NavigationController/ch14_03_navbar.png[Navigation Bar]


Our final step is to add the Add and Delete buttons to the bar. A Navigation Bar can only have two buttons, one to the left and one to right. Moreover, the buttons should be instances of *UIBarButtonItem* not of UIButton. If you remember, we have the methods deleteButton and  addButton to build UIButtons. We can use these buttons as a base to generate our Bar Button Items. *Modify* the setupNavigationBar method to add the buttons to the navigation bar:

[source, ruby]
------------------
def setupNavigationBar

  self.navigationController.navigationBar.setBackgroundImage(UIImage.imageNamed("bgTitleBar"), 
    forBarMetrics:UIBarMetricsDefault)   
  right_button_item = UIBarButtonItem.alloc.initWithCustomView(addButton)
  self.navigationItem.setRightBarButtonItem(right_button_item)
  left_button_item = UIBarButtonItem.alloc.initWithCustomView(deleteButton)
  self.navigationItem.setLeftBarButtonItem(left_button_item)   
end
-----------------

Your app should show the buttons on the Navigation Bar:

.Navigation Bar Button Items

Creating the News Detail Controller
----------------------------------

We have setup our Navigation Controller, now we are going to create the controller to which we are going to navigate to. This controller will show the full text of the news item. We are going to use the Interface Builder to create the View of this controller.

Open the CocoaheadsViews.xcodeproj that is inside the *CocoaheadsViews* folder. Add a new file, in the Wizard select a *View*  and set its name to *NewsItemDetailView*:

.View Creation
image::Resources/ch14-NavigationController/ch14_05_view_creation.png[View Creation]


Setup the view in the Interface Builder as usual:

- Select the File's Owner and in the Identity Inspector to UIViewController. Now Control + click on the File's Owner to display its outlets, link the *view* outlet to the View.

- Select the view, in the *Attributes* inspector set its size to *Retina 3.5" full screen*. In the *File* inspector unselect the *Use Autolayout* option.

We will display 3 things in our View: the title of the news item, the image and the full text of the news item.

- Drag a UILabel to the view, in the *Attributes* inspector set its font to Hoefler of 20 points and its alignment to *Center*, set its tag to 1. In the *Size* inspector, set the frame to x:25, y:13, width:275 and height:44. 

- Drag a UIImageView, set its Frame to x:20, y:67, width:80 and height:80. Set its tag to 2 in the *Attributes* inspector.

- Drag a UITextView and in the *Attributes* inspector unselect the *Editable* option and set its tag to 3. In the *Size* inspector set its frame to x:113, y:63, width:187 and height:310. 

.Interface Builder
image::Resources/ch14-NavigationController/ch14_06_interface_builder.png[Interface Builder]

Our View is ready. Copy the NewsItemDetailView.xib file into the *resources* folder of the RubyMotion project.

Back in our RubyMotion Project, create a file in the *controllers* folder named *news_item_view_controller.rb*. This controller is very simple: it receives a news item and displays it:

[source, ruby]
-----------------
class NewsItemViewController < UIViewController

  attr_accessor :news_item

  TITLE_LABEL_TAG = 1

  IMAGE_VIEW_TAG = 2

  NOTE_TEXTVIEW_TAG = 3

  def viewDidLoad

    setup_title_label
    setup_image_view
    setup_note_text_view    
  end

  
  def setup_title_label

    title_label = self.view.viewWithTag(TITLE_LABEL_TAG)   
    title_label.text = @news_item.title  
  end  


  def setup_image_view

    if @news_item.image

      image_view = self.view.viewWithTag(IMAGE_VIEW_TAG)
      image_view.image = UIImage.imageNamed @news_item.image      
    end  
  end  


  def setup_note_text_view

    note_text_view = self.view.viewWithTag(NOTE_TEXTVIEW_TAG)
    note_text_view.text = @news_item.note
    unless @news_item.image
      note_text_view.frame = [[20,63], [280, 310]]
    end  
  end  

end  
----------------


Now let's go back to our NewsViewController, let's change the implementation of our method:

[source, ruby]
--------------------
def tableView(tableView, didSelectRowAtIndexPath:indexPath)

  p "row #{indexPath.row} selected"
end
-------------------

Now when the user taps on a News item we will navigate to our detail view controller to show the full text. We accomplish that using the *pushViewController:animated:* method:

[source, ruby]
-------------------
def tableView(tableView, didSelectRowAtIndexPath:indexPath)
      
  news_item = @news[indexPath.row]    
  news_item_controller = NewsItemViewController.alloc.initWithNibName("NewsItemDetailView", 
    bundle:nil)
  news_item_controller.news_item = news_item
  self.navigationController.pushViewController(news_item_controller, 
    animated:true)
end
-----------------  


Try it, when you tap on a news item, this view should be displayed:


.Detail Controller
image::Resources/ch14-NavigationController/ch14_07_detail.png[Detail Controller]


As you can see, the navigation controller adds a smooth transition to navigate and a a back button to go back to return to the previous view controller.


Challenge
--------

We've been using the bgTitle.png header image as our navigation bar background. But it looks weird, the navigation bar should have a height of 44 px. and the image is 64 px. that is why the *Cancel* and *Save* buttons look like they are too aligned to the top of the view. Our designer has corrected this situation and created a *bgNavigationBar.png* image of 44 px. Replace it.

In the news_detail_view_controller.rb we need to change the default *back* button. Our designer has made an asset to replace it: *btnBack.png*. Create a UIButton with that image and replace the leftItem of *navigationItem* with that button. The button should call a method called *back*. We have seen that with the method *pushViewController:animated:* we push views to the Navigation Controller View's stack, research the method needed to pop them from the stack. That is the method that you should call in the *back* method:

.Back Button
