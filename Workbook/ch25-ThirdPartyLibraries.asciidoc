Chapter 25 - Third Party Libraries
==================================

Integrating Third Party Libraries (Even if they are in Objective-C ;) into our project is pretty simple using CocoaPods. For this application lets make a simple game called asteroids using a library called Cocos2D

CocoaPods
---------
CocoaPods (cocoapods.org) is a dependency library manager for Objective-C projects, much more like bundler is in rails. Using CocoaPods with a RubyMotion project simplifies all the tasks needed to integrate the library: Just add the Pod to the **RakeFile** and then compile the app. It will download the library, also all of its dependencies and then link them to the app.

Cocos 2D
--------
Cocos 2D (cocos2d-iphone.org) is a framework made it in Objective-C that will allow us to create a 2D Video Game more easy. In this case it will be a old game called Asteroids, the objective of the game is that using a SpaceShip destroy as many meteors as you can without crashing into them

Getting it Running
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First we need to install CocoaPods into our MacOSX, this is done running the following commands into our terminal:

[source, sh]
------------
$ sudo gem install cocoapods

$ pod setup

$ sudo gem install motion-cocoapods
------------


Create the App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lets create a new project called **Asteroids**:

[source, sh]
------------
$ motion create Asteroids
------------

Then integrate Cocos2D into our project editing our **RakeFile**

[source, sh]
------------
$ cd Asteroids

$ open RakeFile
------------

[source, ruby]
--------------
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
$:.unshift("/Library/RubyMotion/lib")
require 'motion/project'
require 'motion-cocoapods'

Motion::Project::App.setup do |app|
  # Use `rake config' to see complete project settings.
  app.name = 'asteroids'

  app.pods do

    pod 'cocos2d'
  end
end
--------------

Well! Lets build our project (It can take a couple of seconds because the weight of the Cocos2D library):

[source, sh]
------------
$ rake
------------

Now please copy the file **RubyMotionSchedule.h** from **Define Deployment Target** into /vendor/Pods/cocos2d/cocos2d, next delete the file **Pods.bridgesupport** that is on /vendor/Pods and finally clean the project:

[source, sh]
------------
$ rake clean

$ rake
------------


The Cocos2D library is now integrated into our project! Easy right?


Building a Game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first thing we need to understand is how the video games work, different from a regular application where the code is executed when an event happen (User interaction, Notification, etc) on video games there is always a loop calling methods for different proposes like refreshing screen, calling the game physics or asking something to the AI. Thankfully in Cocos 2D we have an object that its main responsibility is manage the loop, this class is called **CCDirector**

Before start coding please copy the images from **DEFINE DEPLOYMENT PATH** into the project resources folder. Now implement the following on our **AppDelegate**:

NOTE: The CCDirector is the responsible for running the game or pausing it, also it can handle when a phone call or text message happen so it can automatically pause the game

NOTE: The number of times the loop runs per second is called FPS (Frames per second), and it depends on how fast the methods are executed in every loop call

[source, sh]
------------
$ cd app

$ open app_delegate.rb
------------

[source, ruby]
--------------
class AppDelegate

  def application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions)

    # Create a window to present our director
    @window = UIWindow.alloc.initWithFrame(UIScreen.mainScreen.bounds)

    # Lets create a Cocos 2D view that will be used by the director
    # to present the game scenes
    gl_view = CCGLView.viewWithFrame(@window.bounds,
                                     pixelFormat: KEAGLColorFormatRGBA8,
                                     depthFormat: 0,
                                     preserveBackbuffer: false,
                                     sharegroup: nil,
                                     multiSampling: false,
                                     numberOfSamples: 0)


    # Get the Director shared instance for customization
    @director = CCDirector.sharedDirector

    # Specify that we want to run the game in fullscreen
    @director.wantsFullScreenLayout = true

    # Tell the director that we want to present the FPS on
    # the screen
    @director.displayStats = true

    # The prefered speed on our game (FPS)
    # Note: This is only a prefered value its not garantied you will
    # get that value
    @director.animationInterval = 1.0/60

    # Assign the view used for the director to present the
    # game scenes
    @director.view = gl_view

    # Create a navigation controller to store our game director and
    # hide its navigation bar so we can use all the sreen
    @navigation_controller = UINavigationController.alloc.initWithRootViewController(@director)
    @navigation_controller.navigationBarHidden = true

    # Assign the navigation controller to the window
    @window.rootViewController = @navigation_controller
    @window.makeKeyAndVisible


    # Configuration for our game images, this is very helpful
    # when you want to use compressed images or with a different
    # pixel format
    CCTexture2D.defaultAlphaPixelFormat = KCCTexture2DPixelFormat_RGBA8888
    CCTexture2D.PVRImagesHavePremultipliedAlpha(true)

    # Configuration for the names of the images that will be
    # used on the game
    file_utils = CCFileUtils.sharedFileUtils
    file_utils.enableFallbackSuffixes = false
    
    # The retina display images will be named with "-hd" instead of
    # "@2x"
    file_utils.setiPhoneRetinaDisplaySuffix "-hd"
    
    true
  end

end
--------------

You should see the following:

.Initial Cocos 2D Application
image::Resources/ch25-ThirdPartyLibraries/ch25_Cocos2DInitialApplication.png[Initial Cocos 2D Application]

If you look closely in the bottom left part of the screen are a bunch of numbers, they are the FPS of our game. The general idea is that our game have consistently 60.0 but you will look as we advance in the exercise that some times it drops, this is normal.

Scenes
~~~~~~
We can understand the **Scenes** as levels on a video game, but also can be used for the initial menus or score boards after. Its main responsibility is to manage all the objects that will appear on the screen when the scene is run. On our game this objects will be the space background, ship and asteroids

Lets create a new scene named **space_scene.rb**:

[source, sh]
------------
$ mkdir scenes

$ cd scenes

$ touch space_scene.rb
------------

[source, ruby]
--------------
class SpaceScene < CCScene

 def init

   if super


   end

   self
 end

end
--------------

Now we have a new empty Scene that will allow us to start presenting the game images but before we get to that part we need to tell the **Director** to run this scene, this is do with the following in our **app_delegate.rb** file:

[source, sh]
------------
$ cd ..

$ open app_delegate.rb
------------

["source", "ruby", args="-O \"hl_lines=55 56 57 58 59 60 61\""]
--------------
def application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions)

  # Create a window to present our director
  @window = UIWindow.alloc.initWithFrame(UIScreen.mainScreen.bounds)

  # Lets create a Cocos 2D view that will be used by the director
  # to present the game scenes
  gl_view = CCGLView.viewWithFrame(@window.bounds)


  # Get the Director shared instance for customization
  @director = CCDirector.sharedDirector

  # Specify that we want to run the game in fullscreen
  @director.wantsFullScreenLayout = true

  # Tell the director that we want to present the FPS on
  # the screen
  @director.displayStats = true

  # The prefered speed on our game (FPS)
  # Note: This is only a prefered value its not garantied you will
  # get that value
  @director.animationInterval = 1.0/60

  # Assign the view used for the director to present the
  # game scenes
  @director.view = gl_view

  # Create a navigation controller to store our game director and
  # hide its navigation bar so we can use all the sreen
  @navigation_controller = UINavigationController.alloc.initWithRootViewController(@director)
  @navigation_controller.navigationBarHidden = true

  # Assign the navigation controller to the window
  @window.rootViewController = @navigation_controller
  @window.makeKeyAndVisible


  # Configuration for our game images, this is very helpful
  # when you want to use compressed images or with a different
  # pixel format
  CCTexture2D.defaultAlphaPixelFormat = KCCTexture2DPixelFormat_RGBA8888
  CCTexture2D.PVRImagesHavePremultipliedAlpha(true)

  # Configuration for the names of the images that will be
  # used on the game
  file_utils = CCFileUtils.sharedFileUtils
  file_utils.enableFallbackSuffixes = false
  
  # The retina display images will be named with "-hd" instead of
  # "@2x"
  file_utils.setiPhoneRetinaDisplaySuffix "-hd"
 
  # Tell the director to present the SpaceScene, it works similar to a
  # navigation controller: Push to present & Pop to dismiss
  #
  # If you look closelly to the initialization of the scene we are using
  # the node method, instead of new or alloc init this is because Cocos 2D
  # do some memory allocation performance upgrades 
  @director.pushScene(SpaceScene.node)

  true
end
--------------

Now we can start adding graphical elements to our game!

Layers
~~~~~~
In Cocos 2D exists some objects to allow us to render graphical components (Sprites, Particles) on the screen, these are named **CCLayers**. But do not exist layers (CALayers) in iOS already?  Yes they are, but this have some differences: One of the more important is that the CCLayers can handle touches too!

IMPORTANT: A sprite is a two dimensional image that is integrated in a bigger scene and can be moved on-screen or manipulated as a single unit. On short an image ;)

Knowing this lets create our first CCLayer named **background_layer**:

[source, sh]
------------
$ mkdir layers

$ cd layers

$ touch background_layer.rb

$ open background_layer.rb
------------

[source, ruby]
--------------
class BackgroundLayer < CCLayer

  def init

    if super

      # For testing proposes lets create a CCLabel to present 
      # some text on the screen
      label = CCLabelTTF.labelWithString('Its so cool to make a game', 
                                         fontName:'Marker Felt', 
                                         fontSize:24)

      # We need to get the screen size for positioning the label 
      window_size = CCDirector.sharedDirector.winSize

      # Like the CALayers the position is set in reference to the center
      # of the label, in this case we want the label to be in the middle
      # of the screen
      label.position = CGPointMake(window_size.width / 2, window_size.height / 2)

      # Add the label to the Layer
      self.addChild(label)
    end

    self
  end

end
--------------

Great! Our layer is complete, now lets add it to the scene:

[source, sh]
------------
$ cd ..

$ cd scenes

$ open space_scene.rb
------------

["source", "ruby", args="-O \"hl_lines=5 6 7 8 9\""]
--------------
def init

  if super

    # Create a new instance of a Background Layer
    background_layer = BackgroundLayer.node

    # Add it to the scene
    self.addChild(background_layer)
  end

  self
end
--------------

If you run the app you should see the following:

.Cocos 2D Layer
image::Resources/ch25-ThirdPartyLibraries/ch25_Cocos2DLayer.png[Cocos 2D Layer]

Now we have all the necessary structure to make the game run: A director, scene and a layer! Its time to change the label into a space background:

[source, sh]
------------
$ cd ..

$ cd layers

$ open background_layer.rb
------------


["source", "ruby", args="-O \"hl_lines=5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17\""]
--------------
def init

  if super

    # Create a new sprite with our background image
    background_sprite = CCSprite.spriteWithFile('bgSpace.png')

    # We need to get the screen size for positioning the sprite 
    screen_size = CCDirector.sharedDirector.winSize

    # Like the CALayers the position is set in reference to the center
    # of the label, in this case we want the sprite to be in the middle
    # of the screen
    background_sprite.position = CGPointMake(screen_size.width / 2, screen_size.height / 2)
    
    # Add the sprite to the Layer
    self.addChild(background_sprite)
  end

  self
end
--------------

.Background Layer
image::Resources/ch25-ThirdPartyLibraries/ch25_BackgroundLayer.png[Background Layer]

We have a background for the game! Lets do something more fun: adding the space ship into the scene, for this we need to create a new layer called **game_play_layer.rb**:

[source, sh]
------------
$ touch game_play_layer.rb
------------

[source, ruby]
--------------
class GamePlayLayer < CCLayer

  def init

    if super

      # Create a new sprite instance for drawing our spaceship
      @space_ship_sprite = CCSprite.spriteWithFile('bgSpaceShip.png')

      # We need to get the screen size for positioning the sprite 
      screen_size = CCDirector.sharedDirector.winSize

      # Like the CALayers the position is set in reference to the center
      # of the label, in this case we want the sprite to be in the middle
      # of the screen
      @space_ship_sprite.position = CGPointMake(screen_size.width / 2, screen_size.height / 2)
      
      # Add the sprite to the Layer
      self.addChild(@space_ship_sprite)

      # Enable handle touches on the layer
      self.isTouchEnabled = true
    end

    self
  end

end
--------------

Now that we have our space ship layer its time to add it to the scene:

[source, sh]
------------
$ cd ..

$ cd scenes

$ open space_scene.rb
------------

["source", "ruby", args="-O \"hl_lines=12 13 14 15 16\""]
--------------
def init

  if super

    # Create a new instance of a Background Layer
    background_layer = BackgroundLayer.node

    # Add it to the scene
    self.addChild(background_layer)


    # Create a new instance of a Game Play Layer
    game_play_layer = GamePlayLayer.node

    # Add it to the scene
    self.addChild(game_play_layer)
  end

  self
end
--------------

.Static Space Ship
image::Resources/ch25-ThirdPartyLibraries/ch25_StaticSpaceShip.png[Static Space Ship]

Awesome! The next step is to allow the user to move the space ship with his touches on the screen. Lets open again our **game_play_layer.rb** and add the following method:

[source, sh]
--------------
$ cd ..

$ cd layers

$ open game_play_layer.rb
--------------

[source, ruby]
--------------
# Method for handling the initial touch of the user
# Very similar to the way iOS manage it
def ccTouchesBegan(touches, withEvent:event)

  # Get any touch of the user
  touch = touches.anyObject

  # Because we are not using a UIView or anything related
  # we need to use a method to convert the touch position 
  # coordinate space into the layer space
  touch_location = self.convertTouchToNodeSpace(touch) 

  # Move the spaceship to the touch position
  @space_ship_sprite.position = touch_location
end
--------------

.Jumping Space Ship
image::Resources/ch25-ThirdPartyLibraries/ch25_JumpingSpaceShip.png[Jumping Space Ship]

Yes it moves! But it does without animation, this is because the sprites does not have implicit animations like a CALayer.

Animations in the Space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The animations in Cocos 2D are called actions, so lets create a action for the ship so it will move to the location of the touch in a animated way:

["source", "ruby", args="-O \"hl_lines=13 14 15 16 17 18\""]
--------------
# Method for handling the initial touch of the user
# Very similar to the way iOS manage it
def ccTouchesBegan(touches, withEvent:event)

  # Get any touch of the user
  touch = touches.anyObject

  # Because we are not using a UIView or anything related
  # we need to use a method to convert the touch position 
  # coordinate space into the layer space
  touch_location = self.convertTouchToNodeSpace(touch)

  # We need to create a MoveBy action for the animated movement
  action = CCMoveBy.actionWithDuration(0.3, 
                                       position:touch_location)

  # Execute the action in our Space Ship Sprite
  @space_ship_sprite.runAction(action)
end
--------------

IMPORTANT: We are not really animating the movement, just making it frame by frame using the game FPS. (Interpolation ;)

.Space Ship Outside Screen
image::Resources/ch25-ThirdPartyLibraries/ch25_SpaceShipOutsideScreen.png[Space Ship Outside Screen]

Upps! What when wrong? The problem is the actions must receive the number of points of movement in a direction, not a exact position! You can try it! Just assign a **CGPoint(100, 100)** to the position parameter of the action.

The fix is the following:

["source", "ruby", args="-O \"hl_lines=13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22\""]
--------------
# Method for handling the initial touch of the user
# Very similar to the way iOS manage it
def ccTouchesBegan(touches, withEvent:event)

  # Get any touch of the user
  touch = touches.anyObject

  # Because we are not using a UIView or anything related
  # we need to use a method to convert the touch position 
  # coordinate space into the layer space
  touch_location = self.convertTouchToNodeSpace(touch)

  # Get the current position of the space ship
  current_location = @space_ship_sprite.position

  # Calculate the difference between the two points
  location_difference = CGPointMake(touch_location.x - current_location.x,
                                    touch_location.y - current_location.y)

  # We need to create a MoveBy action for the animated movement
  action = CCMoveBy.actionWithDuration(0.3, 
                                       position:location_difference)

  # Execute the action in our Space Ship Sprite
  @space_ship_sprite.runAction(action)
end
--------------

.Moving Space Ship
image::Resources/ch25-ThirdPartyLibraries/ch25_MovingSpaceShip.png[Moving Space Ship]

Now is working! We are done with the space ship, the next is to add some asteroids flying into the scene.


CCSprite
~~~~~~~~
Now is time to create some asteroids for our game, also its time to learn how to create more complex sprites. Lets begin adding a new class named **asteroid_sprite.rb**:

[source, sh]
------------
$ cd ..

$ mkdir sprites

$ cd sprites

$ touch asteroid_sprite.rb
------------

[source, ruby]
--------------
class AsteroidSprite < CCSprite

  # This is the designated initializer of the CCSprite
  def initWithTexture(texture, rect:rect)
    
    if super

      self.position = CGPointMake(100, 100)
    end

    self

  end

  # Method for optimizing the code needed to instantiate
  # a new asteroid
  def self.sprite

    AsteroidSprite.spriteWithFile('bgAsteroid.png')
  end

end
--------------

Lets add our new sprite to the **game_play_layer.rb**:

[source, sh]
------------
$ cd ..

$ cd layers

$ open game_play_layer.rb
------------

["source", "ruby", args="-O \"hl_lines=22 23\""]
--------------
def init

  if super

    # Create a new sprite instance for drawing our spaceship
    @space_ship_sprite = CCSprite.spriteWithFile('bgSpaceShip.png')

    # We need to get the screen size for positioning the sprite 
    screen_size = CCDirector.sharedDirector.winSize

    # Like the CALayers the position is set in reference to the center
    # of the label, in this case we want the sprite to be in the middle
    # of the screen
    @space_ship_sprite.position = CGPointMake(screen_size.width / 2, screen_size.height / 2)

    # Add the sprite to the Layer
    self.addChild(@space_ship_sprite)

    # Enable handle touches on the layer
    self.isTouchEnabled = true

    # Add an asteroid sprite to our layer
    self.addChild(AsteroidSprite.sprite)
  end

  self
end
--------------

.Big Asteroid
image::Resources/ch25-ThirdPartyLibraries/ch25_BigAsteroid.png[Big Asteroid]

Easy right? But we have a problem the asteroid is too big: Imagine five of them flying into the screen, impossible to dodge!

So lets create something more complex, the idea is to have asteroids of different sizes moving across the screen. So lets use some randoms for determinate the size of the asteroid:

[source, sh]
------------
$ cd ..

$ cd sprites

$ open asteroid_sprite.rb
------------

["source", "ruby", args="-O \"hl_lines=7 8 9\""]
--------------
attr_accessor :state

# This is the designated initializer of the CCSprite
def initWithTexture(texture, rect:rect)
  
  if super
    @state = :spawning

    spawn
  end

  self

end

# Method that will manage the spawning points, size 
# and trayectory of the asteroid
def spawn 

  # Lets create a Random and generate a number between
  # 25 and 75, the maximum and minimum size for the asteroid
  random = Random.new
  sprite_size = random.rand(25..75)

  # Scale the sprite according to our new generated size 
  self.setScaleX(sprite_size / self.contentSize.width)
  self.setScaleY(sprite_size / self.contentSize.height)

  self.position = CGPointMake(100, 100)
end
--------------

.Random Size Asteroid
image::Resources/ch25-ThirdPartyLibraries/ch25_RandomSizeAsteroid.png[Random Size Asteroid]

Great! Now the size of the asteroid is completely random, to test it run the app multiple times!

For make the illusion that the asteroids are coming from the space we need to set the initial position of it outside the screen and then move it across the screen. Again some randoms we will help us, lets add the following method to our file:

[source, ruby]
--------------
# Method for calculating positions around the screen
def position_outside_screen

  # Instantiate a new random
  random = Random.new

  # Generate a new random that we will use to determinate
  # in which screen side is the point
  screen_side = random.rand(1..4)

  # We need to get the screen size for positioning the sprite 
  screen_size = CCDirector.sharedDirector.winSize

  x = 0
  y = 0

  # According to the side of the screen generate the coordinates
  # also we need to take in count the size of the sprite, so it 
  # can be completely outside the screen

  # Top Side
  if screen_side == 1

    x = random.rand(1..screen_size.width)
    y = -self.contentSize.height

  # Left Side
  elsif screen_side == 2
    
    x = -self.contentSize.width
    y = random.rand(1..screen_size.height)

  # Right Side     
  elsif screen_side == 3

    x = 320 + self.contentSize.width
    y = random.rand(1..screen_size.height)
    
  # Bottom Side
  else 

    x = random.rand(1..screen_size.width)
    y = 480 + self.contentSize.height

  end

  CGPointMake(x, y)
end
--------------

Now lets use this method for assign an initial position to our asteroid and create an action for its movement across the screen: 

["source", "ruby", args="-O \"hl_lines=15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35\""]
--------------
# Method that will manage the spawning points, size 
# and trayectory of the asteroid
def spawn 

  # Lets create a Random and generate a number between
  # 25 and 75, the maximum and minimum size for the asteroid
  random = Random.new
  sprite_size = random.rand(25..75)

  # Scale the sprite according to our new generated size 
  self.setScaleX(sprite_size / self.contentSize.width)
  self.setScaleY(sprite_size / self.contentSize.height)


  # Generate an initial and final position for the asteroid
  initial_position = position_outside_screen
  final_position = position_outside_screen

  # Calculate the difference between the two positions
  position_difference = CGPointMake(final_position.x - initial_position.x,
                                    final_position.y - initial_position.y)


  # Lets use another random that we will use for the movement speed
  action_speed = random.rand(4..7)
  
  # Create a Move By Action for its movement across the screen
  action = CCMoveBy.actionWithDuration(action_speed, 
                                       position:position_difference)

  # Assign the initial position
  self.position = initial_position
  
  # Run the movement action
  self.runAction(action)
end
--------------

.Flying Asteroid
image::Resources/ch25-ThirdPartyLibraries/ch25_FlyingAsteroid.png[Flying Asteroid]

You should see the asteroid fly across the screen! If you don't please run it a couple of times remember we are using randoms! (The asteroid can fly too fast or in the edges of the screen, this is part of the magic ;)

But the asteroids does not move like that! They rotate:

["source", "ruby", args="-O \"hl_lines=37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44\""]
--------------
# Method that will manage the spawning points, size 
# and trayectory of the asteroid
def spawn 

  # Lets create a Random and generate a number between
  # 25 and 75, the maximum and minimum size for the asteroid
  random = Random.new
  sprite_size = random.rand(25..75)

  # Scale the sprite according to our new generated size 
  self.setScaleX(sprite_size / self.contentSize.width)
  self.setScaleY(sprite_size / self.contentSize.height)


  # Generate an initial and final position for the asteroid
  initial_position = position_outside_screen
  final_position = position_outside_screen

  # Calculate the difference between the two positions
  position_difference = CGPointMake(final_position.x - initial_position.x,

Last part! We need to change the status of the sprite to **:ended** when the movement action ends:

["source", "ruby", args="-O \"hl_lines=34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44\""]
--------------
# Method that will manage the spawning points, size 
# and trayectory of the asteroid
def spawn 

  # Lets create a Random and generate a number between
  # 25 and 75, the maximum and minimum size for the asteroid
  random = Random.new
  sprite_size = random.rand(25..75)

  # Scale the sprite according to our new generated size 
  self.setScaleX(sprite_size / self.contentSize.width)
  self.setScaleY(sprite_size / self.contentSize.height)


  # Generate an initial and final position for the asteroid
  initial_position = position_outside_screen
  final_position = position_outside_screen

  # Assign the initial position
  self.position = initial_position

  # Calculate the difference between the two positions
  position_difference = CGPointMake(final_position.x - initial_position.x,
                                    final_position.y - initial_position.y)


  # Lets use another random that we will use for the movement speed
  action_speed = random.rand(1..5)
  
  # Create a Move By Action for its movement across the screen
  action = CCMoveBy.actionWithDuration(action_speed, 
                                       position:position_difference)

  # Instantiate a Call Function to excecute a method when the movement 
  # action finished
  finish_callback_action = CCCallFuncND.actionWithTarget(self, 
                                                         selector:'movement_action_ended', 
                                                         data:nil)

Now our asteroid sprite is finished! So for the game makes sense it should be multiple asteroids flying across the screen right? Thats next!

FPS + Asteroid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Do you remember that at the beginning of the exercise we talk about that the director executes a method multiple times a second to let us do some work like talk to the AI, Physics or refreshing the screen? Lets use this method for maintain a constant number of asteroids on the screen: creating them and then when it movement finishes destroy them.

Lets open again our **GamePlayLayer** and subscribe to the loop notification:

[source, sh]
------------
$ cd ..

$ cd layers

$ open game_play_layer.rb
------------

["source", "ruby", args="-O \"hl_lines=22 23 24 25 26\""]
--------------
def init

  if super

    # Create a new sprite instance for drawing our spaceship
    @space_ship_sprite = CCSprite.spriteWithFile('bgSpaceShip.png')

    # We need to get the screen size for positioning the sprite 
    screen_size = CCDirector.sharedDirector.winSize

    # Like the CALayers the position is set in reference to the center
    # of the label, in this case we want the sprite to be in the middle
    # of the screen
    @space_ship_sprite.position = CGPointMake(screen_size.width / 2, screen_size.height / 2)

    # Add the sprite to the Layer
    self.addChild(@space_ship_sprite)

    # Enable handle touches on the layer
    self.isTouchEnabled = true

    #Create an array for storing our asteroid sprites
    @asteroids = NSMutableArray.alloc.init

    # Subscribe to the loop call
    scheduleUpdate
  
  end

  self
end

# Loop callback method
def update(time)

end
--------------

IMPORTANT: Please take a closer look to the code because we remove the add of the initial asteroid sprite and add an array for storing the asteroid sprites

Now is time to add some asteroids to our game, implement the following on the **update** method:

["source", "ruby", args="-O \"hl_lines=4\""]
--------------
# Loop callback method
def update(time)

  spawn_asteroids
end


def spawn_asteroids

  # Delete the asteroids that are on ended state
  @asteroids.delete_if { | asteroid |

    # If the asteroid is on ended state
    if asteroid.state == :ended

      # Remove from the layer also
      self.removeChild(asteroid, cleanup:true)

      true        
    end
  }

  # Calculate the number of asteroids missing, taking
  # in count that we should have 15 moving around
  missing_asteroids = 15 - @asteroids.count
  
  # Iterate to create the missing asteroids
  for i in 0..missing_asteroids - 1

    # Create an asteroid sprite
    asteroid_sprite = AsteroidSprite.sprite

    # Add it to the layer and to the array
    self.addChild(asteroid_sprite)
    @asteroids.addObject(asteroid_sprite)
  end
end
--------------

.Multiple Asteroids

Awesome! Now the scene is complete, but is something missing right? Detect when the ship crashes with an asteroid!

Please don't crash!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The last part of our exercise is to detect when the asteroid crashes with our space ship! For this lets add the following method:

["source", "ruby", args="-O \"hl_lines=5\""]
--------------
# Loop callback method
def update(time)

  spawn_asteroids
  check_for_collisions
end

def check_for_collisions

  # Iterate all the asteroids in the scene
  @asteroids.each { | asteroid |

    # If any asteroid frame intersect the space ship frame
    # is a collision
    if CGRectIntersectsRect(asteroid.boundingBox, @space_ship_sprite.boundingBox)
    
      # Create a new sprite instance for our explosion
      explosion_sprite = CCSprite.spriteWithFile('bgBoom.jpeg')
     
      # Set the sprite in the same exact position of the 
      # space ship
      explosion_sprite.position = @space_ship_sprite.position

      # Add the explosion sprite into our layer
      self.addChild(explosion_sprite)

      # Pause the game
      CCDirector.sharedDirector.pause
    end
  }
end
--------------

.Please Don't Crash
image::Resources/ch25-ThirdPartyLibraries/ch25_PleaseDontCrash.png[Please Don't Crash]

Great! Now our little game is complete, if the user crashes into an asteroid the space ship explodes and the game is ended

IMPORTANT: Even if you are a master moving your ship sometimes it will crash without touching any asteroid, this is because collision detection is more like an art and it depends on more advanced techniques like physics or sprite sheets to be pixel perfect. But that subjects are not in the scope of this course :'(

Challenges
~~~~~~~~~~
. Add a "Game Over" scene to the game when a collision happen, remember that the CCDirector can push new scenes into the screen

. Detect when the user touches an asteroid so you can remove it from the screen, clearing the way for our space ship to move
