## UIViewControllers

A view controller manages a set of views that make up a portion of your app’s user interface. As part of the controller layer of your app, a view controller coordinates its efforts with model objects and other controller objects—including other view controllers—so your app presents a single coherent user interface.

+ Resizes and lays out its views
+ Adjusts the contents of the views
+ Acts on behalf of the views when the user interacts with them
